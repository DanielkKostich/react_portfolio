# Portfolio App

Welcome to my Portfolio App! This project serves as a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and other relevant information. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.


## Technologies Used

The Portfolio App is built with the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: Enables client-side routing within the application.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web pages.
- CSS: Styling language for designing the app's appearance.

## Installation and Setup

To run the Portfolio App locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project as a ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

### npm install


This will install all the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

4. Once the installation is complete, start the development server with the command:

### npm start


This will launch the app and make it accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.



## Deployment

To deploy the React Portfolio App to a web server or hosting platform, follow these general steps:

1. Build the optimized production-ready version of the app by running the following command:

### npm run build


This will generate a `build` folder containing the optimized and minified version of the app.

2. Upload the contents of the `build` folder to your web server or hosting platform. Make sure to configure the server or platform to serve the `index.html` file as the entry point.
